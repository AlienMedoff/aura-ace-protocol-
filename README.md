## 💎 Project Overview
"AURA ACE" is a sovereign L2-gateway designed to bridge high-probability AI signals with on-chain liquidity providers (specifically Storm Trade). 

The protocol is optimized for the $1 retail segment, allowing millions of Telegram users to trade via a gamified, high-frequency interface while maintaining institutional-grade security.


## ⚙️ Technical Architecture (The "Fortress" Edition)

The core AuraFortressGateway is engineered for zero-trust execution. It solves the problem of secure AI signal delivery to the blockchain.

### Key Security Features:
* Multi-Oracle Consensus (2-of-N): Every execution requires valid signatures from at least two independent AI Oracle nodes.
* Sequential Nonce Protection: Each user wallet follows a strict `current_nonce + 1` logic, eliminating replay attacks.
* Strict Execution Window: Signals expire within 30 seconds to protect users from MEV-frontrunning.
* Stake-to-Play: An economic barrier (5 TON stake) to filter out bot-farms and sybil attacks.

### Governance & Safety:
* 48h Timelock: Critical parameters are guarded by a 48-hour delay, making rug-pulls impossible.
* Sentinel Roles: Dedicated "Circuit Breaker" roles for instant emergency pausing without fund management rights.
* CEI Pattern: Strict adherence to *Check-Effects-Interactions* for 100% reentrancy protection.
